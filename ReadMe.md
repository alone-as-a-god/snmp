# Features
As of now this program supports the following functionality:
 - Scan a single IP for fixed OID values
 - Scan a whole network automatically for fixed OID values
 - Receive traps

### Usage
No need to install anything, just download the latest release, unzip it, and start "main.exe".
If you're using Windows, SmartScreen could come up and warn you about insecure software, just ignore it (or scan it with a Virus Scanner to be sure it's safe).

You can also just download the source code, and run main.py, to make this work you obviously have to have Python installed (recommended ver. 3.8+)
After that, open a terminal, and run "pip install pysnmp" and "pip install keyboard"

To begin, type ```/help```

### Todos

 - Make scan
 - Scan IP via mib file
 - Make it possible to interrupt "Receive Trap" function, without program crashing
 - Fix issues (see issues page)
